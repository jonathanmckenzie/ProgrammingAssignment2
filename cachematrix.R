## The following functions allow the calculation of the inverse of a matrix to
## be cached.  This means the inverse is calculated at most once and improves
## performance when multiple calls to invert the matrix are made.

## makeCacheMatrix generates a "cacheable" matrix.  This is used as input to the
## function cacheSolve

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

    # Function to set the value of the matrix.
    set <- function(mat_set) {
        x <<- mat_set
        # On creation of matrix, inverse is not known
        inv <<- NULL
    }
    
    get <- function() x
    setInverse <- function(inv_set) inv <<- inv_set
    getInverse <- function() inv
    
    # Return the cachematrix as a list of getters and setters
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setInverse = setInverse,
         getInverse = getInverse)
}

## cacheSolve determines the inverse of a "cacheable" matrix (x).  If the 
## inverse is stored, then this inverse is returned without futher calculation

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {

    # Read from the input x and check if the inverse is cached
    cached_inv <- x$getInverse()
    if (!is.null(cached_inv)) {
        message("Inverse is cached, returning cached value")
        return(cached_inv)
    }

    # We execute the following only when inverse needs to be calculated
    mat <- x$get()
    inv_mat <- solve(mat)
    x$setInverse(inv_mat)

    # We have now cached the calculated inverse, return this to user
    inv_mat
}
